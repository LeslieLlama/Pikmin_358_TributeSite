        Blue Pikmin #358 braved so many underwater missions it was straight up insane. We're talking at least 10 without being eaten or exploded. just last week I saw a yellow pikmin get eaten as soon as it popped out of the onion like it didnt even reach the ground a wandering bulbmin snached it right out the air like woah. Here's a timeline of this incredible soldiers lifestyle.
